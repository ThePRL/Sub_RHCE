Chapter 1 - Introducing Ansible:
- Outcomes: You should be able to install automation content navigator on a control node. 

- As user 'student' on the 'workstation' node:
	- Step 1: begin with "lab start intro-install"
	- Step 2: Install ansible-navigator
	- Step 3: Install the Execution Environment from 'utility.lab.example.com'
		- Username: admin
		- Password: redhat
	- Step 4: Close the lab with 'lab finish intro-install'

Chapter 2 - Implementing an Ansible Playbook
- Outcomes: You should be able to construct and run an Ansible Playbook to install, configure, and verify the status of web and database services on a managed host. 
	- The inventory, ansible.cfg, and ansible-navigator.yml, have been pre-configured for this lab.

- Step 1: "lab start playbook-review" -> cd into '/home/student/playbook-review' directory
- Step 2: Create 'internet.yml' playbook with the following tasks:
	- Intended for 'serverb.lab.example.com'
	- Enable Privilege Escalation
	- Install the latest versions of the following:
		- firewalld 
		- httpd 
		- mariadb-server
		- php
		- php-mysqlnd
	- Ensure the following are running and enabled.
		- firewalld
		- httpd
		- mariadb
	- Ensure firewalld enables access for http service
	- Add the necessary entry that uses 'ansible.builtin.copy' module to copy '/home/student/playbook-review/index.php' file to 'var/www/html/index.php'
		- Mode setto 0644' 
- Step 3: In a new play, have the control node test access to the web server
	- Web server is: 'serverb.lab.example.com'.
	- This task does not require privilege escalation
	- Use the 'ansible.builtin.uri' module, look for a return status code of 200.
- Step 4: "lab grade playbook-review"
- Step 5: "lab finish playbook-review"

Chapter 3 - Managing Variables and Facts
- Outcomes: You should be able to define variables and use facts in a playbook, as well as use variables defined in an encrypted file.

- Step 1: 'lab start data-review' -> 'cd data-review'

- Step 2: Create playbook.yml to do the following to the group 'webserver' (serverb.lab.example.com):
	- Ensure the following variables are listed in the play:
		- firewall-pkg: firewalld
		- firewall_svc: firewalld
		- web_pkg: httpd
		- web_svc: httpd
		- ssl_pkg: mod_ssl
		- httpdconf_src: files/httpd.conf
		- httpdconf_dest: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
		- htaccess_src: files/.htaccess
		- secrets_dir: /etc/httpd/secrets
		- secrets_src: files/htpasswd
		- secrets_dest: "{{ secrets_dir }}/htpasswd"
		- web_root: /var/www/html
	- Write the following tasks:
		- Ensure latest versions of necessary packages are installed
			- firewall_pkg
			- web_pkg
			- ssl_pkg
		- With the ansible.builtin.copy module, copy over "{{ httpdconf_src }}" to "{{ httpdconf_dest }}"
			- Ensure file is owned by user & group: root
			- Set permissions to '0644'
		- With the ansible.builtin.file module, ensure "{{ secrets_dir }}" exists.
			- Owned user and group: apache
			- Set permissions to '0500'
		- With the ansible.builtin.copy module, add an htpasswd file, for basic auth of web users.
			- The source should be "{{ secrets_src }}"
			- Destination shoudl be "{{ secrets_dest }}" 
			- Owned user and group: apache
			- Set permissions to '0400'
		- With the ansible.builtin.copy module, add create a .htaccess file in the document root directory of the web server.
			- Copy the file "{{ htaccess_src }}" variable to "{{ web_root }}/.htaccess. 
			- Owned user and group: apache 
			- Set permissions to '0400'
		- With the ansible.builtin.copy module, copy 'index.html' to "{{ web_root }}"
			- The file should contain the message " HOSTNAME (IPADDRESS) has been customized by Ansible."
				- Where the hostname is the FQDN of the host and it displays the IPv4 address
			- Use the 'content' option to specify the contents of the file.
			- Use ansible facts to determin the needed information 
		- With the ansible.builtin.service module, enable and start "{{ firewall_svc }}"
		- With ansible.posix.firewalld module, enable access to https service
			- Should be immediate and permanent
		- With the ansible.builtin.service module, enable and start the web service on the managed hosts 
			- Name should be "{{ web_svc }}"

- Step 3: In a new play within playbook.yml:

        - Add a directive to the play that incorporates vars/secret.yml.
                - This file contains a variable named "{{ web_pass }}" that specifies the password for the web user.
                        - This file is created later

	- With the ansible.builtin.uri module, use the 'workstation' machine to test the web server. 
		- URL: https://serverb.lab.example.com
		- It does not need privilege escalation
		- define a variable named "web_user" with the value "guest" 
		- Use the "{{ web_user }}" and "{{ web_pass }}" variables to authenticate.
		- Task should verify status code of 200
		- Register the task result in a variable named "{{ auth_test }}"

	- With the ansible.builtin.debug module, print the content returned from the web server, which is contained in the "{{ auth_test }}" variable

- Step 4: Create vars/secret.yml file, encrypted with ansible-vault. 
	- Use the password 'redhat'
	- It should set the web_pass variable to 'redhat', which is the web user password

- Step 5: run the playbook

- Step 6: 'lab grade data-review' 

- Step 7: 'lab finish data-review'

Chapter 4: Implementing Task Control: 
- Outcomes:
	- Define conditionals in Ansible Playbooks
	- Set up loops that iterate over elements
	- Define handlers in playbooks
	- Handle task errors

- Step 1: "lab start control-review ; cd control-review"

- Step 2: Using 'ansible.builtin.fail' module, create a task in playbook.yml that compares system ram to variable "{{ min_ram_mb }}" and that the system is running RHEL. 

- Step 3: Ensure all packages are installed and updated to latest. 
	- Use the "{{ packages }}" variable 

- Step 4: Enable all required services in a loop

- Step 5: Under the '#Block of config tasks' comment, add a task block containing:
        - A task to ensure the directory specified by the 'ssl_cert_dir' variable exists on the remote host. This directory stores the web server's certificates
        - A task to copy all files specified by the 'web_config_files' variable to the remote host. Examine the structure of the 'web_config_files' variable in the vars.yml file. Configure the task to copy each file to the correct destination on the remote host
	- This task should trigger the 'restart web service' handler if any of these files are changed on the remote server.
        - Additionally a debug task is executed if either of the two tasks above fail. In this case, the task prints the following message: "one or more of the config changes failed, but the web service is still active."

- Step 6: The play configures the remote host to listen for standard HTTP/HTTPS requests. Under the '#Configure the firewall' comment, add a task to configure 'firewalld'
        - The config changes must be effective immediately and persist after a reboot.

- Step 7: Create a 'restart web service' handler

- Step 8: Run the playbook, ensure no errors and the handler task executes

- Step 8: Access the web server
