Section 5.2: Modifying and Copying Files to Hosts

- Step 2:
- name: Guided exercise 5.2 - step 2 (fetch log files)
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: true
  remote_user: root

  tasks:
    - name: Using fetch to grab files
      ansible.builtin.fetch:
        src: /var/log/secure
        dest: secure-backups/
        flat: false

- Step 3: 
---
- name: Step 3 - Create the copy-file.yml file
  hosts: all
  remote_user: root

  tasks:
    - name: Copy file to all hosts
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        src: /home/student/file-manage/files/users.txt
        dest: /home/devops/users.txt
        owner: devops
        group: devops
        mode: u+rw,g-wx,o-rwx
        setype: samba_share_t

- Step 4: 
---
- name: Step 4 - Set default SELinux context on the file users.txt
  hosts: all
  remote_user: root

  tasks:
    - name: using the file module, set default SELinux context on users.txt for 'user, role, type, and level'
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /home/devops/users.txt
        seuser: _default
        serole: _default
        setype: _default
        selevel: _default


- Step 5:
---
- name: Step 5 - add a line
  hosts: all
  remote_user: devops

  tasks:
    - name: add a line using the lineinfile command
      ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
        path: /home/devops/users.txt
        line: This line was added by the lineinfile module.
        state: present

- Step 6: 
---
- name: step 6 - create block to append file
  hosts: all
  remote_user: devops

  tasks:
    - name: Create a block using 'blockinfile' module
      ansible.builtin.blockinfile:
        path: /home/devops/users.txt
        block: |
          This block of text consists of two lines.
          They have been added by the blockinfile Module.
        state: present

- Step 7:
---
- name: step 7 - removing the file
  hosts: all
  remote_user: devops

  tasks:
    - name: using the ansible.builtin.file module, remove /home/devops/users.txt
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /home/devops/users.txt
        state: absent
