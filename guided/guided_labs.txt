Chapter 5: Deploying Files to a managed host

Section 5.2: Modifying and Copying Files to Hosts
- Outcomes: 
	- Retrieve files from managed hosts, by host name, and store them locally
	- Create playbooks that use common file management modules from the 'ansible.builtin' collection. Such as:
		- copy
		- file
		- lineinfile
		- blockinfile

- Step 1: "lab start file-manage; cd file-manage"

- Step 2: Create a playbook called "secure_log_backups.yml"
